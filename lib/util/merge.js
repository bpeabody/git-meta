    // TODO: better commit message. What I'm doing isn't quite like Git, which
    // will tell you if the commitish is a branch or commit name.

    // Basic algorithm:
    // - start merge on meta-repo
    // - detect changes in sub-repos
    // - merge changes in sub-repos
    // - if any conflicts in sub-repos, bail
    // - finalize commit in meta-repo

    //
    // - oddities with and/or poor support of submodules
    // - unlike rebase and cherry-pick, which seem similar on the surface, the
    //   merge operation doesn't operate directly on the current HEAD, index,
    //   or working directory: it creates a weird virtual index
    //
    // I haven't created issues for nodegit or libgit2 yet as I'm not sure how
    // many of these problems are real problems or "by design".  If this
    // project moves out of the prototype phase, we should resolve these
