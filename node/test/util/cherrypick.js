    // submodules will have the submodule name appended to the commit.
    //
    // One concern with these tests is that the logic used by Git to generate
    // new commit ids can result in collision when the exact same commit would
    // be generated very quickly.  For example, if you have this setup:
    //
    // S:C2-1;Bfoo=2
    //
    // And try to cherry-pick "2" to master, it will likely generate the exact
    // same physical commit id already mapped to "2" and screw up the test,
    // which expects a new commit id.  This problem means that we cannot easily
    // test that case (without adding timers), which is OK as we're not
    // actually testing libgit2's cherry-pick facility, but also that we need
    // to have unique commit histories in our submodules -- we can't have 'S'
